Welcome to Spring 2023 SDS 290: Research Design and Analysis. You will find most of the course content here, but also please keep an eye on [Moodle](http://moodle.smith.edu) for grades and assignments. Use the server version of `RStudio` on the [web here](http://rstudio.smith.edu), although I recommend you install R on your computer ([instructions](https://smithcollege-sds.github.io/sds100/lab_01_setup.html)).

Check the course schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VIHs_2swDFnkW2ZLJWqQ4sh8SRVGZFgmJg8ukphfIVs/edit?usp=sharing) for assigned readings and major deadlines.
